# setupdevtools
Scripts for building my develop environment but only for the all non-installation develop tools.  

Just as a memo to help re-construct develop environment easily and quickly. Ideally, I will commit both script and document for each tool.:grin:  

Here it the list:  
[cmder](http://cmder.net/)  
[everything and its command tools(es)](https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/)
